Equality of Polygons

def: Two polygons P and Q are scissors congruent if there exist a finite number of cuts of P that when arranged, form Q.

Theorem: Any 2 polygons of the same area are scissors congruent.

To explore why this is true, make your own polygons P and Q, we will step through how to cut P to transform it into Q.

First, click anywhere to begin making P. Click subsequent points to create vertices of P, being sure not to overlap the polygon you are already constructing. When you are done, click back into the orange circle. Then, do similarly for Q. Once you are done, we cut it for you.

First, it known that every polygon can be cut into triangles. Then, for each triangle, we cut it and rearrange it into a rectangle. 

Then for each of those rectangles, we cut and rearrange it into rectangles of a constant width. 

We then stack those rectangles to form a stack.

Then, we cut new rectangles from this stack and form rectangles that can be turned into triangles. Then those triangales are placed accoringly.
